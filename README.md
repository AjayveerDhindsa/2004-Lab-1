# 2004-Lab-1
Computational Aerodynamics

The purpose of this lab was to begin learning fundamental aircraft design skills. In this lab we took 2-D wing data from the MH 32 Airfoil and using this data we computed the aerodynamic properties of a 3-D wing and compared these results to CFD data from the Tempest UAS.
